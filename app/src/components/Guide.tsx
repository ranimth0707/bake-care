    <section className="faq"><h2>What you should know</h2>
      <details><summary>What is the difference between the reserve and a contribution?</summary><p>The reserve is locked when you join and held separately from the pool. For new campaigns, it must be at least the contribution × the number of members, so remaining obligations can be covered. Contributions are paid every round to build the pool. Unused reserve can be withdrawn after the Arisan ends.</p></details>
      <details><summary>What happens if someone does not pay?</summary><p>After the deadline, anyone can cover the missed contribution from that member's reserve. Their reserve balance decreases, but the round pool stays whole. If the reserves are not sufficient, the program locks the draw and payout until the shortfall is repaired—other members are never forced to cover it.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Does the demo use real money?</summary><p>The simulation above is only an example. Get demo COOK and campaigns in the app use real transactions on Cookie Chain mainnet. Check the amount before approving a wallet transaction.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Does the code restrict who can join?</summary><p>Not completely. The app asks for a code to open a room, but the current blockchain program does not have strong membership authorization. Technical users may bypass the app-level code gate. Details and the ledger are public, so do not treat the code as a privacy or identity guarantee.</p></details>
